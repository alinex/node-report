::: info Auto {size=scroll}
This is a very long note to show how it will look in the different display modes which will show it minimized, maximized or with an scroll bar. It is shown in the minimized form at start but you may click it into scroll or maximized view as you like. In any other output which is not html it will always be displayed in full size (maximized). You may use the icons on the top left to change the appearance of this box if you want to minimize it, to open back in auto size (with possible scrollbars) or to maximize like in print view.
