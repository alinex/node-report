This report module should help you create complex reports in an easy
way. You create a new object and append different text objects step by step. At last
you may access the markdown text or get it converted to HTML.

The key features are:

- easy markdown writing
- feature rich markdown
- export as text, console, html (also optimized for email), pdf, png or jpg
- convert text to visual representation like qr, chart or UML
- optimized interactive tables

See example output within the different element descriptions below.

Internally this works with a markdown syntax which has a limited number of possibilities
but is easy to transform in nearly any other format. If you know markdown you will
find the possibilities here enormous. And you may also directly load markdown and
process it using this package.

The html export can also be optimized for email using `Ã¬nlineCss` option. With
this the styles from the head section will moved into the document because
webmail client will remove the head section completely. Only for javascript there
is no possible replacement.

> It is one of the modules of the [Alinex Namespace](https://alinex.github.io/code.html)
> following the code standards defined in the [General Docs](https://alinex.github.io/develop).

Install
-------------------------------------------------

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/alinex-database.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)
 ![Downloads](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/alinex-database.png?months=9&height=3)
](https://www.npmjs.com/package/alinex-database)

The easiest way is to let npm add the module directly to your modules
(from within you node modules directory):

``` sh
npm install alinex-report --save
```

And update it to the latest version later:

``` sh
npm update alinex-report --save
```

This package will install a lot of subpackages to ensure the full functionality
but only the ones really needed are loaded on demand.

Always have a look at the latest [changes](Changelog.md).


Usage
-------------------------------------------------

The first step is to load the module and setup it:

``` coffee
Report = require 'alinex-report'
Report.setup ->
  # go on
```

And now you create a new object:

``` coffee
report = new Report()
```

You may also give some of the following options:

- `source` - markdown text to preload
- `log` - a function called each time something is added with the added text
- `width` - the width for line breaks (default: 80)

### Report builder

The report builder is a collection of methods used to easily create the needed
markup. They often are handy to convert your objects into formatted text:

``` coffee
report.h1 "My Test"
report.p "This is a short demonstrative test with:"
report.list [
  "headings"
  "text blocks"
  "unnumbered lists"
]
```

### Format output

And finally get the complete result:

``` coffee
console.log report # same as report.toString()
text = report.toString() # markdown syntax
html = report.toHtml()   # html
log = report.toConsole() # text with ansi colors
```

### Convert to Markdown

Instead of creating a report to collect everything, you can also let this module
convert single elements on the fly:

``` coffee
console.log Report.ul ['one', 'two', 'three']
console.log Report.p "This text contains a #{Result.b 'bold'} word."
```

### Markdown as Base

If you want to only convert existing markdown into html do this like:

``` coffee
html = new Report({source: markdownText}).toHtml()
```
### Mask characters

To mask some characters to be not interpreted as markdown, you may use `\` before

the special markdown signs or automatically mask them using `Report.mask text`
if you didn't want to interpret them as markdown.


Output
-------------------------------------------------
You have multiple possibilities to output the created markdown object.

### Markdown

Example: [markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alinex/node-report/master/src/doc/test.md)

To get this native output you can directly convert the object to a string:

``` coffee
report.toString()
```

### Text Output

Example: [text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alinex/node-report/master/src/doc/test.txt)

``` coffee
report.toText()
```

Here all non presentable elements are removed to get a clean plain text output.
This means the table of contents, decorator rules and backslashes at the end of line
are removed as well as image sources.

### Console Output

``` coffee
report.toConsole()
```

This is targeted to output on the console. Therefore the plain text from above will
be marked with ascii escape sequences to add color highlighting. All markup which
is possible in console like bold, strikethrough, italic... will be used.

Tables will be drawn using ASCII art grid lines.

### HTML Document

Example: [html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/alinex/node-report/blob/master/src/doc/test.html)

``` coffee
report.toHtml() # deprectaed syntax without inline css support

report.toHtml options, (err, html) ->
  # use the html
```

Options are:

- title (string) - to be used instead of h1 content
- style (string) - reference to the used style under var/src/template/report/xxx.css
- locale (string) - language to use like 'de'
- inlineCss (boolean) - move css from head to the tags as styles (useful for mails)
- noJS (boolean) - make everything static
- contexxt (object) - additional elements for handlebars template

This is the most powerful output method. In which all markdown elements will be
supported and interpreted. It will create one HTML file to be used in emails...

Only links to internet resources like images and css are kept as they are. local
links in the format 'file:///....' will be replaced with their content included
as data uri in the document. This makes the document larger but helps to keep
everything in one file. In emails you may extract these again and replace them
with cid uri to the now attached resource.

### PDF Document

Example: [PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alinex/node-report/master/src/doc/test.pdf)

``` coffee
report.toPdf (err, data) ->
  # [](you may store this to a file)
```

You can also give some options:

``` coffee
report.toPdf options, (err, data) ->
  # you may store this to a file
```

Possible options are:

- format - A3, A4, A5, Legal, Letter or Tabloid
- height - like "10.5in" allowed units: mm, cm, in, px
- width - like "8in" allowed units: mm, cm, in, px
- orientation - portrait or landscape
- border - like "0" allowed units: mm, cm, in, px \
  or as an object with top, right, bottom nad left settings

### Image

Example: [PNG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alinex/node-report/master/src/doc/test.png)

``` coffee
report.toImage (err, data) ->
  # you may store this to a file
```

### File

Also you may let the report be written directly to a file.

``` coffee
report.toFile filename, options, (err) ->
  # you may store this to a file
```

The format will be autodetected from the filename's extension.
