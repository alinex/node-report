Report Elements
=================================================

The report builder is a collection of methods used to easily create the needed
markup. They often are handy to convert your objects into formatted text. In
contrast you may define the markup by yourself (see below) and use the `raw()`
method to add it in already formatted markdown.

Often the text output will look like the markdown and the console output sometimes,
too.

Settings to be done before using the reporter:

``` coffee
# globally
Report.width = 80
# only for instance
report = new Report()
report.width = 80
```

This setting will define the maximum line length (default is 80 characters). All
methods which use it have the ability to overwrite this default setting with an
individual number.

You may also set the width on the instance instead of globally giving it as a
parameter to the constructor. See the usage above.
